LayoutJs
========

Create greatly laid out applications in JavaScript. 

Laying out complex UIs can be very challenging in CSS. LayoutJS allows to quickly lay out your application by using layout panels in your element hierarchy.

It can serve as the View in your MVC or MVVM architecture or you can just use it for parts of your UI. 

#####Target Applications
LayoutJS is primarily meant for use in Single Page Applications (SPA).

#####CSS
CSS was originally developed to quickly and simply lay out document style pages. While there have been many additions over the years, like e.g. the flex box laying out great web applications is still very error prone for non CSS ninja experts. CSS is both used to position elements on the screen as well as to lay them out. LayoutJS clearly separates these two concerns. 

#####Philosophy
LayoutJS is meant for those who need to get work done. For those who want to quickly and effectively create great user experiences.

It focusses first on helping you implement your design as quickly and reliably as possible. While UI performance is important, developer productivity is even more important. It creates the time you need to think about performant designs and resolve the few bottlenecks you might have.

LayoutJS is for those who want to do great work, not for those who want to be famous. LayoutJS is not for those who just react to the work of others. LayoutJS is there for those who create through their actions.
